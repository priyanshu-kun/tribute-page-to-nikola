            <div class="about-nikola">Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
                alternating-current (AC) electric
                system, which is the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the
                "Tesla coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in modern-day Croatia, Tesla came to the
                United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several
                patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.</div>

            <ul class="life-of-nikola">
                <li><b>1856- </b>on July 10, Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia.</li>
                <li><b>1870- </b>After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the Johann-Rudolph-Glauber
                    Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of
                    Prague during the 1870s, Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central
                    Telephone Exchange.</li>

                <li><b>1880- </b>working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry.</li>
                <li><b>1884- </b>he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.</li>
                <li><b>1888- </b>His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed
                    by Westinghouse Electric,earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the
                    polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</li>
                <li><b>1890- </b>Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power
                    distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs.
                </li>
                <li><b>1910s and 1920- </b> with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived
                    in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills.</li>
                <li><b>1943- </b>He died in New York City in January (age: 86).</li>
                <li>Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General
                    Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his
                    honor.</li>
